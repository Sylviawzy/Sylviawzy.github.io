**Hi, I'm Zhongyu (Sylvia) Wei, welcome to my homepage!**

In 2019, I graduated from the [Harvard Graduate School of Education](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/) with a Master of Education degree. My research focus on **the role of sociocognitive model in the development of language and literacy skills throughout early childhood to (pre-)adolescence**. Prior to attending Harvard, I received my dual bachelor degrees in [English Linguistics](http://www.wwx.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/fdllen/index.html) and [Economics](http://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) from [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/) in 2018.

I have provided research assistance for the design and evaluation of multiple large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at enhancing children's language and literacy development in relatively low-resource areas in both United States and China. The projects I have been involved in consist of：
- [Model of Reading Engagement (MORE)](https://www.readslab.org/more-study) from the [READS Lab](https://www.readslab.org/) at Harvard University
- Global Learner Project at [Language for Learning Research Group](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/uccelli) at Harvard University
- [Catalyzing Comprehension through Debates and Discussion project (CCDD)](https://ccdd.serpmedia.org/) within the IES-funded RCT of the [Word Generation](https://wordgen.serpmedia.org/) academic language and reading curriculum
- [Chinese Early Rural Education Collaborative (CEREC)](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Quality-improvement-of-early-childhood-education-in-rural-China)

My name in Chinese characters is 魏钟毓, which comes from a Chinese idiom 钟灵毓秀，meaning to breed the talent from the land.

## Selected Research Projects

#### Residential Segregation and Educational Institutions 
- _Advisor: Luke Miratrix (Assistant Professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education)_
- In this study, I constructed a _dissimilarity index_ with a sociological strategy, based on [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/) & [IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) data, and built a multilevel model using R to examine variation in segregation within and across 2,980 counties.

#### Quality Improvement of Early Childhood Education in Rural China
- _Advisor: Catherine Snow (Professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education), Dr. Si Chen_
- The purpose of the study is to determine whether strategies for quality improvement in early childhood education (e.g., providing picture books to the classroom, conducting teacher training et) will improve the vocabulary and cognitive development of young children and child-teacher interaction quality in rural China. This study is collaborating with the [One Village One Preschool Project](http://www.cdrf.org.cn/hcyey/index.jhtml) launched by [China Development Research Foundation](http://www.cdrf.org.cn/).
- I designed a CLAN-based coding scheme measuring the motivational resources in teacher-child interactions. Using a random sample of 21 classrooms, that is, a total of 630-minute classroom activities, I coded the autonomy support, relatedness support, and competence support reflected in teachers' language use, and modeled links with preacademic outcomes. 
- Based on preliminary findings, I designed content for online teacher training for 56 local preschool teachers

## Hobbies

I love reading classics and poems. Presently I'm interested in the English poems written by American poet and scholar [Rosanna Warren](http://www.rosannawarren.com/). Upon her consent, I co-published the Chinese translations and appreciations of her poems _Porta Portese_ and _Romanesque_ on the _English Language Learning_ journal. I also won the 1st prize in the English Budding Writers Competition for _English Language Learning_ for my two articles in 2018.
