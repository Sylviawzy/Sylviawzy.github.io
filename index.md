## Hobbies

I love reading classics and poems. I'm interested in the English poems written by American poet and scholar [Rosanna Warren](http://www.rosannawarren.com/). Upon her consent, I co-published the Chinese translations and appreciations of her poems _Porta Portese_ and _Romanesque_ on the _English Language Learning_ journal. I also won the 1st prize in the English Budding Writers Competition for _English Language Learning_ for my two articles in 2018.
