**Hi, I'm Zhongyu (Sylvia) Wei, welcome to my homepage!**

I'm an Ed.M candidate at the [Harvard Graduate School of Education](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/), specializing in International Education Policy. My research focuses on identifying effective early childhood interventions to improve student outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. I'm also passionate about providing robust evidence to answer policy-relevant questions. Prior to attending Harvard, I received my dual bachelor degrees in English Linguistics and Economics from [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/) in 2018.

During my undergrad I focused on **advanced vehicle propulsion systems**. I was fortunate to work on vehicular proton-exchange membrane fuel cell(PEMFC) under supervision of [Prof. Liangfei Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=jGWQpRkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) in my senior year. In summer 2017, I was a visiting scholar at [Center for Automotive Research](https://car.osu.edu), The Ohio State University to work on powertrain control and optimization of plug-in hybrid electric truck under supervision of [Prof. Giorgio Rizzoni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jtephu8AAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Daniel Jung](http://users.isy.liu.se/en/fs/daner/) and [Dr. Qadeer Ahmed](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZQost2wAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interest is **planning and decision-making of autonomous vehicle in mixed-autonomy traffic** using machine learning and control theory.

#### Stabilizing Traffic using Inverse Reinforcement Learning

This project aims at exploring the potential of attenuating velocity perturbation in a mixed traffic flow using inverse reinforcement learning, using acceleration feedback-based connected car-following behavior as expert demonstration.

In other words, we see if an autonomous car can ”learn” such optimal behavior without knowledge of the preceding vehicle’s acceleration in real time.
