**Hi, I'm Zhongyu (Sylvia) Wei, welcome to my homepage!**

I'm an Ed.M. candidate at the [Harvard Graduate School of Education](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/), specializing in International Education Policy. My research focuses on identifying effective early childhood interventions to improve student outcomes, particularly for at-risk populations. I'm also passionate about providing robust evidence to answer policy-relevant questions. Prior to attending Harvard, I received my dual bachelor degrees in [English Linguistics](http://www.wwx.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/fdllen/index.html) and [Economics](http://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) from [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/) in 2018.

I have engaged in several researches on the **evaluation of early childhood interventions targeting at-risk students, with a focus on children’s literacy and socio-emotional development**. Since July 2017, I have been a research assistant to [Professor Catherine Snow](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Catherine_Snow), [Professor Paola Uccelli](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paola_Uccelli), and [Assistant Professor Dana McCoy](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dana_Mccoy) on projects including: [Catalyzing Comprehension through Debates and Discussion project (CCDD)](https://ccdd.serpmedia.org/), [Expanding Children’s Early Learning Network (ExCEL-P3)](https://www.mdrc.org/project/expanding-children-s-early-learning-excel-network), [Chinese Early Rural Education Collaborative (CEREC)](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Quality-improvement-of-early-childhood-education-in-rural-China), Global Learner Project at [Language for Learning Research Group](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/uccelli), and [Settings for Early Child Education and Development (SEED)](https://seed.gse.harvard.edu/).

My name in Chinese characters is 魏钟毓, which comes from a Chinese idiom 钟灵毓秀，meaning to breed the talent from the land.

## Selected Research Projects

#### Residential Segregation and Educational Institutions 
- _Advisor: Luke Miratrix (Assistant Professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education)_
- In this study, I constructed a _dissimilarity index_ with a sociological strategy, based on [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/) & [IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) data, and built a multilevel model using R to examine variation in segregation within and across 2,980 counties.

#### Quality improvement of early childhood education in rural China
- _Advisor: Catherine Snow (Professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education), Dr. Si Chen_
- The purpose of the study is to determine whether strategies for quality improvement in early childhood education (providing picture books to the classroom, conducting teacher training, helping teachers design lesson plans) will improve the vocabulary and cognitive development of young children and child-teacher interaction quality in rural China. This study is collaborating with the [One Village One Preschool Project](http://www.cdrf.org.cn/hcyey/index.jhtml) (the only nation-wide early childhood education intervention in China launched by [China Development Research Foundation](http://www.cdrf.org.cn/).

## Hobbies

I love reading classics and poems. Presently I'm interested in the English poems written by American poet and scholar [Rosanna Warren](http://www.rosannawarren.com/). Upon her consent, I co-published the Chinese translations and appreciations of her poems _Porta Portese_ and _Romanesque_ on the _English Language Learning_ journal. I also won the 1st prize in the English Budding Writers Competition for _English Language Learning_ for my two articles in 2018.
