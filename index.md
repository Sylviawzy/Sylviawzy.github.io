**Hi, I'm Zhongyu (Sylvia) Wei, welcome to my homepage!**

I'm an Ed.M candidate at the [Harvard Graduate School of Education](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/), specializing in International Education Policy. My research focuses on identifying effective early childhood interventions to improve student outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. I'm also passionate about providing robust evidence to answer policy-relevant questions. Prior to attending Harvard, I received my dual bachelor degrees in [English Linguistics](http://www.wwx.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/fdllen/index.html) and [Economics](http://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) from [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/) in 2018.

I have engaged in several researches on the **evaluation of early childhood interventions, with a focus on children’s literacy and socio-emotional development**. Since July 2017, I have been a research assistant to [Professor Catherine Snow](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Catherine_Snow), [Professor Paola Uccelli](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paola_Uccelli), and [Assistant Professor Dana McCoy](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dana_Mccoy) on projects including: [Catalyzing Comprehension through Debates and Discussion project (CCDD)](https://ccdd.serpmedia.org/), [Expanding Children’s Early Learning Network (ExCEL-P3)](https://www.mdrc.org/project/expanding-children-s-early-learning-excel-network), [Chinese Early Rural Education Collaborative (CEREC)](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Quality-improvement-of-early-childhood-education-in-rural-China), Global Learner Project at [Language for Learning Research Group](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/uccelli), and [Settings for Early Child Education and Development (SEED)](https://seed.gse.harvard.edu/).

## Selected Projects

#### Residential Segregation and Educational Institutions 
In this study, I constructed a _dissimilarity index_ with a sociological strategy, based on [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/) & [IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) data, and built a multilevel model using R to examine variation in segregation within and across 2,980 counties.

## Hobbies

I love reading classics and poems. I'm particularly interested in the English poems written by American poet and scholar [Rosanna Warren](chicago.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/External). Upon her official consent, I translated and published her poems _Porta Portese_ and _Romanesque_ on the _English Language Learning_ journal. I also won the 1st prize in the Budding Writers Competition for _English Language Learning_ in 2018.
